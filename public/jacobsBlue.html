            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p class="dm">
              Jacob's Blue is a recording artist, producer, musician, and songwriter. Before this project there was no
              home base for Jacob's Blue other than an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jacobs_blue/"
                class="inline">instagram page</a>. An important aspect to his storytelling style is not just delivering
              an auditory experience but building a world from which the music he makes comes from and which his
              audience can find themselves. I was tasked with designing, creative directing, and developing the website.
              An important note is that I am Jacob's Blue lol.

            <p class="dm">
              In addition to being the new home for Jacob's Blue, where users should be able to easily navigate to find
              all things related to the artist. The website was also meant to emphasize and tell the story of his latest
              release and debut album "Born in the Sunset: Thoughts to Oasis." Due to limited resources the website
              became the main delivery tool for additional storytelling and needed to become an immersive experience for
              those listening to the project, fans both returning and new.

          <div class="paragraph">

              That being said time was also an important constraint. The album was already submitted to streaming
              services with a 8 day window before it went live. That meant the site had to accomplish several things
              within and 8 day window.

              Users don't know the story and haven't heard the music of <em>Born in the Sunset: Thoughts to Oasis</em>
              by Jacob's Blue. They need to be able to find out more, explore the world he's created, and most
              importantly play his music. Two important constraints are time, and the fact that most users will have
              never heard of Jacob's Blue.

            <p class="dm">
              The audience for Jacob's Blue was already defined. For context, the majority of Jacob's Blue listeners
              were in one place already. Instagram. That meant that I would have one link in bio directing all users to
              one place. I needed users familiar with Jacob's Blue to be able to navigate to the link and intuitively,
              find what they needed, but if they wanted ,to also be able to embrace the storytelling experience laid out
              before them.

          <div class="paragraph">

              In addition to familiar fans, I knew this site and project would serve as the introduction for many new
              listeners to Jacob's Blue. It was important that I make it very simple for those users to also navigate
              the site and find their way through the content.

              objectives and user needs in the quickest and most effective way possible. I was more or less thinking MVP

            <h3>Mobile First</h3>
            <p class="dm">
              To reiterate, the majority of people navigating to this site would be coming from Instagram, Jacob's
              Blue's main audience base. Factoring in this information and my need for speed in this production, I
              decided to design a mobile first single column layout. This made development incredibly straightforward as
              I only needed 1 breakpoint to accommodate all styles.

            <h3>Sticky and Accesible Nav</h3>
            <p class="dm">
              A principle I try my best to maintain, especially in an instance like this where user traction is low, is
              that a navigation menu shouldn't be hidden until they have to be. Users may not even know who Jacob's Blue
              is yet, so if they come here and can't find what they're looking for immediately it most likely means they
              won't be listening at all. Both in the mobile and desktop experiences the nav is not hidden and is
              intentionally sticky so that at any point in the users' experience they're able to get what they
              ultimately came for, the music.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="paragraph">
            <p class="dm">
              An important piece of context is that most artists use a <a class="inline"
                href="https://linktr.ee/?utm_source=googlesearch&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=lnk000&utm_content=bau&gclid=Cj0KCQjwyN-DBhCDARIsAFOELTllgQTyEVlJTjPfF-lyG2hl5TrWRYwOvbHx7PzAIZWmoig1mhDQa84aAiHyEALw_wcB">Linktree</a>
              in their link in bio on their social accounts. Linktree is more or less a landing page that houses links
              to everything relevant to that artist. It's an amazing tool for artist, thus it's popularity has risen
              recently. I had to assume users were used to this experience more than a website they had never been too.

          <div class="paragraph">
            <p class="dm">
              In order to combat this, I made sure there was a button that leads users to my own linktree where users
              could navigate to every streaming service humanly imaginable, both in the sticky nav and hero banner.

              Surfaced in the nav other than the linktree button, are the most popular streaming services for users

              3 clicks away.

              The creation of the album was a personal process and I wanted to bring users into that world. As part of
              the enhancements I added to the desktop experience I added handwritten notes as vector graphics
              throughout, so that users almost felt like they were in the book, from which I created the entire album.

            <p class="dm">
              Part of the process for this album was the production of an accompanying script. The album and script are
              meant to be packaged and read together so I wanted to create an environment where people could both read
              and listen easily. When users navigate to the script page, there is the script itself, a Spotify
              web-player embed for playing the album, and the ability to download the script for easier reading.

            <h2>Step 6: Deliverables and Outcome</h2>
            <p class="dm">
              Overall, considering the timeline or not, this project was wildly successful. It strongly exceeded my
              expectations. As I hypothesized early in the project, the vast majority of users viewed the site from a
              mobile platform. Around 84% of users viewed Jacobs.blue on mobile. The site handled almost 1000 unique
              visitors with no bugs or crashes. The site and album have received quality press from more than 5 other
              websites. And qualitatively, I received over 60 personal messages from people speaking about their
              fondness of the site and album.

              I wouldn't change anything about the design at the moment but one thing that bothered me quite a bit is
              that there is a small delay upon loading the page. It's the not the biggest deal in the world but there
              are definitely a lot of large images that I can either downsize or use a compression engine in the future
              to optimize page loading and site performance.

              But that's it. I look forward to more challenges, tight windows, and album rollouts like this in the
              future. Thanks for being here and if you haven't already, check out the <a class="inline"
