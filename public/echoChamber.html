                  <h3>Birth of the Echo Chamber</h3>
                  <p class="dm">
                    Thanks to the brilliant documentarians at Netflix responsible for *The Social Dilemma* documentary that came out earlier this year, the aforementioned problems that all whom take a second to wonder at, can just "feel" in our society...those problems became all too real. Backed in fact, product designer and engineering anecdotes, and pathos, <a>The Social Dilemma</a> became wildly popular. You see, it's easy to say that we turned social media into an echo chamber but, at least from the documentary's perspective, algorithms that reinforced our basic desires, were to blame. Most users don't follow people they disagree with or try to keep around content they don't like. It's not a comfortable thing to challenge your ideas. This led to explosions of backlash and the hyper-personalization of ideas. Back to my joke...haha

                <p class="dm">
                  Okay we have a real problem, in America in particular, and depending on where you stand, a potentially existential one. <b>We've killed constructive communication</b>, <b>uncomfortable growth in a social setting</b>, and <b>hyper-sensitized every idea</b> to the point that <b>ideas are no longer bad but the people that have them are</b>. Turning back to my friend, after longer than a second, I asked "what if/". What if we could make an app that aimed to solve all of these really challenging social issues in one bite? What if we served something where ideas-instead of people-where at the focal point? What if you could clearly see or at least gain a perspective from the bias of the sender? What if we serve a social media that served as the antithesis of the echo chamber we have all created for ourselves respectively? All we can do is try.

                  <p class="dm">
                    Where does one start when tackling a social dilemma(pardon the pun) like this? Naturally my friend, Will, and I decided to go back to waking ourselves up out of the mess, which even before this experiment we did a decent job of. This involved steps like following people we disagreed with on our own social accounts(@jacobs_blue sorry shameless plug 🤷🏼‍♂️), having thoughtful conversations with people we didn't really agree with to gain perspective about topics we didn't understand, and in general, not watching the news. The most important notion we came across months before this all came to surface was Charlie Munger's famous mental model called The Work to Have An Opinion. To surmise, ole Chuck doesn't have an opinion on anything that he can't inform the other side of the arguments belief better than they can. If one sit's with that quote it becomes clear that we're all just kind of spewing gas and that the world, especially considering today's political climate, would be a much better place if we all followed that mental model. We personally found it so helpful figured this must be part of the solution.

                  <h4>Problem</h3>
                  <p class="dm">
                    Most people communicate in a vacuum. They do not interact with the other side of the fence on any topic but especially important ones. Popular social media apps have become an <b>Echochamber</b>.
                </div>
                </br>

                <div class="paragraph">
                  <h4>Goal/How we solve this problem</h3>
                  <p class="dm">To get people to focus on ideas instead of people and be able to source real conversations in a thoughtful way. Predicated by Charlie Munger's, The Work to Have An Opinion. We want to encourage thoughtful conversations and pull ideal extremities back to the theoretical “middle.” The real solution here is exposure. Echo chambers and vacuums don't allow users the cognition of the theoretical "other side."</p>
                </br>
                  <p class="dm">A nice by-product of this app would be an outpour of more empathy in the world but in order to focus our efforts we targeted three things: <b>idea depersonalization</b>, <b>exposure to a full spectrum of ideas</b>, and <b>the mindset of doing the work to participate in group discussion</b> or earning your seat at the table.</p>
