                  <h2>Birth of the Echo Chamber</h2>
                  <p class="dm">
                    Thanks to the brilliant documentarians at Netflix responsible for <em><a class="inline" href="https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/" target="_blank">The Social Dilemma</em></a> documentary that came out earlier this year, the aforementioned problems that all whom take a second to wonder at, can just "feel" in our society...those problems became all too real. Backed in fact, product designer and engineering anecdotes, and pathos, <em><a class="inline" href="https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/" target="_blank">The Social Dilemma</a></em> became wildly popular. You see, it's easy to say that we turned social media into an echo chamber but, at least from the documentary's perspective, algorithms that reinforced our basic desires, were to blame. Most users don't follow people they disagree with or try to keep around content they don't like. It's not a comfortable thing to challenge your ideas. This led to explosions of backlash and the hyper-personalization of ideas. Back to my joke...haha

                <p class="dm">
                  Okay we have a real problem, in America in particular, and depending on where you stand, a potentially existential one. <b>We've killed constructive communication</b>, <b>uncomfortable growth in a social setting</b>, and <b>hyper-sensitized every idea</b> to the point that <b>ideas are no longer bad but the people that have them are</b>. Turning back to my friend, after longer than a second, I asked "what if". What if we could make an app that aimed to solve all of these really challenging social issues in one bite? What if we served something where ideas-instead of people-where at the focal point? What if you could clearly see or at least gain a perspective from the bias of the sender? What if we serve a social media that served as the antithesis of the echo chamber we have all created for ourselves respectively? All we can do is try.

                  <p class="dm">
                    Where does one start when tackling a social dilemma(pardon the pun) like this? Naturally my friend, Will, and I decided to go back to waking ourselves up out of the mess, which even before this experiment we did a decent job of. This involved steps like following people we disagreed with on our own social accounts(<a href="" class="inline">@jacobs_blue</a> sorry shameless plug ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), having thoughtful conversations with people we didn't really agree with to gain perspective about topics we didn't understand, and in general, not watching the news. The most important notion we came across months before this all came to surface was Charlie Munger's famous mental model called <a class="inline" href="https://fs.blog/2013/04/the-work-required-to-have-an-opinion/" target="_blank"><em>The Work to Have An Opinion.</em></a> To surmise, ole Chuck doesn't have an opinion on anything that he can't inform the other side of the arguments belief better than they can. If one sit's with that quote it becomes clear that we're all just kind of spewing gas and that the world, especially considering today's political climate, would be a much better place if we all followed that mental model. We personally found it so helpful that we figured it must be part of the solution.

                  <h4>Problem</h3>
                  <p class="dm">
                    Most people communicate in a vacuum. They do not interact with the other side of the fence on any topic but especially important ones. Popular social media apps have become an <b>Echo Chamber</b>.
                </div>

                <div class="paragraph">
                  <h4>Goal/How We Solve This Problem</h3>
                  <p class="dm">To get people to focus on ideas instead of people and be able to source real conversations in a thoughtful way. Predicated by Charlie Munger's, <a class="inline" href="https://fs.blog/2013/04/the-work-required-to-have-an-opinion/" target="_blank"><em>The Work to Have An Opinion</em></a>. We want to encourage thoughtful conversations and pull ideal extremities back to the theoretical ‚Äúmiddle.‚Äù The real solution here is exposure. Echo chambers and vacuums don't allow users the cognition of the theoretical "other side."</p>
                </br>
                  <p class="dm">A nice by-product of this app would be an outpour of more empathy in the world but in order to focus our efforts we targeted three things: <b>idea depersonalization</b>, <b>exposure to a full spectrum of ideas</b>, and <b>the mindset of doing the work to participate in group discussion</b> or earning your seat at the table.</p>

                    After initial sketching, some of the most important features became obvious. For example, the testing/comprehension flow is critical to a main point of the app ‚Äî getting people used to the mental model of ‚Äúdoing the work‚Äù to have their opinion.

                </div>

                  <h3>1) Ensuring users did the work</h3>
                  <p class="dm">
                    From the home/feed screen (not pictured) users will find all of the current questions that have an active dialogue associated. From there, they click on a question card and navigate to the individual question screen (pictured far left).

                <div class="paragraph">
                  <p class="dm">
                    There is an important distinction that users only have to go through this testing flow once per question but they do have to go through the testing flow for every question/discussion they wish to participate in. We realized that this was probably pretty annoying for users and caused some friction for the enjoyment of the app ‚Äî but that‚Äôs also kind of the point. Doing the work to have an opinion on a topic isn‚Äôt fun, <b>it‚Äôs important</b>.

                    Working from left to right, users start with the individual question screen. There they will find a couple of things: The question/discussion they‚Äôre about to engage in, a general brief of the topic at hand from a macro perspective in order to give users context (we assume most users will know this context already but kept it in effort to level the cognitive playing field), and some UX writing that reiterates the point that users‚Äô having opinions, at least in this app, are earned. We made it a point throughout the app to include UX writing that reinforces this point in hopes to slowly slide into users‚Äô subconscious the notion that work must be done in order for their opinion to count.

                    Moving right, we included three stages to this testing flow in a waterfall/gant structure: Read, React, and Comment. Users have to complete a phase to move on to the next. We actually really struggled to get this flow right and I‚Äôm not sure if it even is now but we settled on this flow for a few reasons.

                    The main reason being, we didn‚Äôt want to align ourselves as the source of truth for anything ‚Äî even the brief page is weird for us. We felt like this was a super slippery slope that potentially puts us in a bad situation. In order to combat that notion, we sourced all of the testing flow content from comments that already existed from real people. We just made sure the user whose idea we‚Äôre using wasn‚Äôt listed (detaching the idea from the person ‚Äî one of our goals).

                    The test is simple and simultaneously teaches users how to engage with the app. 1) users have to read a certain number of comments. 2) They have to react to the comments. There are tooltips that trigger if it‚Äôs a user‚Äôs first time testing. 3) They are allowed to enter the discussion.

                    It was important that for each phase users either knew exactly what to do or where to find out more if they were confused. Moreover, I wanted users to know where they stood as far as progress so they could see the proverbial ‚Äúlight‚Äù at the end of the tunnel. Copy like the ‚ÄúPhase _ of 3‚Äù and ‚ÄúREAD‚Äù with description copy explaining the process, are integral. The progress bar at the bottom and # of steps left in this phase (pictured ‚Äú2/6‚Äù) are also crucial. Lastly, if users are confused about any of this process, the question icon at the top drops down with thorough explanatory text about the entire process, no matter how far into the flow a user is.

                    Notice a cheeky change in buttons from an ‚Äúarrow-right‚Äù to a ‚Äúplus‚Äù from screens 3 to 4. In order to get users both accustomed to the fact that they earn this button and the fact that it has changed, I included an outline on the screen prior to when the buttons change (screen 3, from left to right). I want users to say, ‚ÄúOoh what is that?!‚Äù, hopefully looking forward to this transition. This hammers home the point, again, that users are not entitled to an opinion but may earn one through work.

                  <h3>2) Reactions that make sense</h3>
                  <p class="dm">
                    In Echochamber users cannot respond directly to each other. However, they can react directly to each others‚Äô comments. We made this decision in order to keep things as amicable as possible. We predicted, in an app where you‚Äôre encouraged to disagree, that there is a high potential for a discussion to get a little heated at times. Thus, we needed a reaction system that was robust enough to communicate the effectiveness of an idea or at least what other users thought of as the effectiveness of the idea and a reaction system that users could quickly and intuitively become familiar with. From a developer standpoint, our reaction system would also serve as a ranking system for serving content within the discussion feed.
                </p>
                </div>

                <div class="paragraph">
                  <p class="dm">
                    ‚ÄúAgree‚Äù and ‚ÄúDisagree‚Äù reactions are fairly straightforward. ‚ÄúThink‚Äù and ‚ÄúFlag‚Äù is where we introduced some nuance. ‚ÄúThink‚Äù is actually the highest-ranking reaction in our ranking algorithm for serving content (theoretical ranking algorithm). The gist is that users react with a ‚Äúü§î‚Äù when a comment made them stop and think, or it enhanced their perspective in any way. The best comments are ones that change our hearts and give us more empathy. This is why the ‚ÄúThink‚Äù reaction ranks highly.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div class="paragraph">
                  <p class="dm">
                    ‚ÄúFlag‚Äù will be used to mark hateful, discriminatory, or inappropriate comments. The ‚ÄúFlag‚Äù reaction has caused some consternation for my friend and I. There are several good reasons for potentially hiding the reaction in a drop-down menu on the card. Ultimately it‚Äôs something I decided we should test with users to know the best setting for it but for now it is a mainstay on the comment card. I definitely want users to have the option to flag something they feel they should, but having the reaction available to easily react with, without going into any sub-menu may be a mistake.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div class="paragraph">
                  <p class="dm">
                    We agreed that censoring speech is very bad for meaningful discussion and we‚Äôve taken a few steps to make sure even on the main comment card it‚Äôs not incentivized to click. For example, users will never see how many flags a comment has. They won‚Äôt be encouraged to add fuel to the fire. We also played with the idea of having a manual review process of flagged comments before being factored into the ranking algorithm. Complications arise quickly with things like ‚ÄúWho decides what is actually flagged and not?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhere does the source of truth fall?‚Äù Again, these are attributes we wanted to avoid completely but the discussion is important. I think there is room for improvement here.

                  <h3>3) Comment structure</h3>
                  <p class="dm">
                    From a high level view, users should be very familiar with this "Contribute" structure. I think it feels very intuitive because it's very similar to Twitter's "compose" structure. In my mind, good UX is constantly playing the line of <b>Intuitive</b> (for the most part unoriginal) and <b>Charming</b> (for the most part original). I think we're striking that balance well here.
                </p>

                <div class="paragraph">
                  <p class="dm">
                    In Echochamber there are three types of comments: Fact, Opinion, and Anecdote. I‚Äôm not professing these to be the end-all-be-all of dynamic dialogue, there is always room for improvement, but I do believe they‚Äôre a good place to start.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div class="paragraph">
                  <p class="dm">
                    With each type of comment comes some dynamic fields. For example, if you select ‚ÄúFact‚Äù, a ‚Äúsource‚Äù field appears. Users can add a source or not but the comment card, in-feed, will indicate whether this fact comment has a source or doesn‚Äôt. There is some engineered public pressure to make sure a user‚Äôs ‚ÄúFact‚Äù has a source. ‚ÄúOpinion‚Äù and ‚ÄúAnecdote‚Äù comments don‚Äôt require a source but it‚Äôs also clear that they are not in fact a ‚ÄúFact‚Äù. lol.
                  </p>

                <div class="paragraph">
                  <p class="dm">
                    Like most compose patterns, users will see some things they are used to, like the ‚ÄúComment‚Äù input field and a ‚ÄúContribute‚Äù button that becomes active when users enter all required fields. A new feature is the spectrum slider at the bottom. We ran into some issues trying to let the app define the biases of each user so we decided to let users decide their own biases. They can decide on each comment which way their statement leans, political left or right (This will be explained in on-boarding and can also be found in a ‚ÄúResource‚Äù tab in the ‚ÄúUser Settings‚Äù screen). This, 1) is interesting data that we plan to surface in a ‚ÄúUser Metrics Dashboard‚Äù so uses can be constantly be made aware of their contributions and 2) gets users used to another mental framework that we think is important ‚Äî asking themselves ‚ÄúWhere do my biases lie? How is my own data skewed?‚Äù
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div class="paragraph">
                  <p class="dm">
                    Lastly, there are several measures of feedback to help inform users of how to use this screen. The ‚ÄúContribute‚Äù button fills a darker color only after required fields are filled. The source field hypothetically will outline green when a source is certified (thinking we make a list of certified sources ‚Äî but just like anytime we play with information, we climb a slippery slope ‚Äî so maybe not) and outlines red when a source isn‚Äôt approved. The ‚Äúcomment‚Äù input field and character count within the field outlines red when users have gone over the character count. Lastly, there is a mention under the bias spectrum slider that users have 10 seconds to delete or edit their comments. This will appear along with the ‚ÄúContribute‚Äù button fade-in.

                  Just like most social applications, Echochamber is an application that relies on network effect for it to be effective, regardless of how ‚Äúanti-social‚Äù we wish it to be. What is Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, without their users? We‚Äôve got a great plan but it assumes we have users. In order for this app to truly be effective and make a difference, we need to get very creative about user acquisition. I don‚Äôt think we have a good solution for this at the moment.

                  Another flaw that seems to tag along with every ‚Äúapplication for good‚Äù I‚Äôve ever come across is the issue of ‚ÄúHow do we make money?‚Äù At the end of the day, this app must become a business to continue to serve its users. I fundamentally despise the idea of leveraging user data to generate capital, thus we also have a lot of work to do to figure out how to make money in a clean way in order to maintain and improve the product.

                <p class="dm">
                  I think a viable MVP model for Echochamber could look something like a Google Chrome extension that parses any social app ‚Äî tells users the bias of the information and scrapes the internet for likely sources of the information. This doesn‚Äôt achieve our goal of doing the work to have an opinion but it does help users digest information in a more meaningful way and hopefully generate some residual intention in users that think about their own contributions after dissecting other‚Äôs ideas. I also think this could be viable with a small team and doesn‚Äôt require as much infrastructure to support ‚Äî thus generating capital becomes less important. It could even be open source and volunteer managed.

It‚Äôs important for the success of the product and I‚Äôve definitely come away from this project with even more appreciation for detail. After all, when we stop learning, we stop living so I‚Äôm extremely grateful for the opportunity to improve.
